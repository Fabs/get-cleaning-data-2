Please upload the tidy data set created in step 5 of the instructions. Please upload your data set as a txt file created with write.table() using row.name=FALSE (do not cut and paste a dataset directly into the text box, as this may cause errors saving your submission).

Please submit a link to a Github repo with the code for performing your analysis. The code should have a file run_analysis.R in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory. The output should be the tidy data set you submitted for part 1. You should include a README.md in the repo describing how the script works and the code book describing the variables.
